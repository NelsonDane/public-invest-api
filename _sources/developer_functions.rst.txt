Developer Functions
===================
These are functions that are used internally by the library and are not meant to be used by the end user.
If you add support for a new endpoint, then you'll have to add a new function here! (in the `endpoints.py` file)

.. automodule:: public_invest_api.public
    :members:
    :private-members:
    :show-inheritance:
    :undoc-members:
    :no-index:

.. automodule:: public_invest_api.endpoints
    :members:
    :show-inheritance:
    :undoc-members:
